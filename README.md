Q1
1a) 
  Even number greater than 8 can be consist of combination of 4s and 6s
  Proof:
   4 = 2x2 , 6 =2x3
  All even numbers are consist of either even or odd number of 2s
  For all V > 8:
  All V= 2*N (N is even) can be consist of 4s
  All V= 2*N (N is odd) can be consist of 4s and 6s

  Odd number Greater than 11 can be turned into even by -9
  So all odd number > 11 is valid

  So the invalids are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
